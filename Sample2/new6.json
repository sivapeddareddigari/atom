We will give the vaccines to subjects who have cancer but have not had treatment, and to patients who have had chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Some patients will get vaccines while they are on treatments which boost the immune system (like the immune stimulating drug interleukin-2 or IL-2). Although we have safely treated many patients with immune boosting drugs, we do not yet know if they improve the body's immune system to respond better to a vaccine. Some healthy volunteers will also be given the vaccines in order to serve as control subjects to get a good measure of the normal immune response. We will compare the patients and the healthy volunteers to study how their immune systems respond to the vaccines.  There are several different types of white cells in the blood. We are interested in immune cells in the blood called T-cells. These T-cells detect foreign substances in the body (like viruses and cancer cells). We are trying to learn more about how the body fights these foreign substances. Our goal is to develop cancer vaccines which would teach T-cells to detect and kill cancer cells better. We know that in healthy people the immune system effectively protects against recurrent virus infection. For example, that is why people only get \"mono\" (mononucleosis) once under normal circumstances. When the body is infected with the \"mono\" virus, the immune system remembers and prevents further infection. We are trying to use the immune system to prevent cancer relapse. To test this, we will give two vaccines which have been used to measure these immune responses.

The significance of this research is that oral tissue taken from the top of the mouth or palate is in limited supply and leaves the patient with a painful and uncomfortable post surgery experience. If we are successful with our technique the patient will experience less pain and discomfort from the site that we are using to grow our tissue outside the body than if we had taken it from the top of the mouth or palate.

To determine if negative symptoms and cognitive function improve over time, if these improvements meaningfully impact quality of life factors, if they correlate with markers of neuronal function, and if subpopulations can be identified according to response.  Dysfunction of glutamatergic neuronal systems has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on the finding that non-competitive inhibitors of the NMDA receptor can reproduce in normals the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Furthermore, glutamatergic dysfunction may alter forebrain dopaminergic neuronal activity, a system central to the antipsychotic action of typical neuroleptics. It is believed that enhancing NMDA receptor function by systemic treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor, will reduce symptoms in schizophrenia.

Continuation Aim 1 is to track the persistence of intervention-related effects as the MTA sample matures into mid-adolescence, including subsequent mental-health and school-related service utilization patterns as a function of MTA treatment experience (treatment assignment) and outcome (degree of treatment success at 14 mo.). Aim 2 is to test specific hypotheses about predictors, mediators, and moderators of long-term outcome among children with ADHD (e.g., comorbidity; family functioning; cognitive skills; peer relations) that may influence adolescent functioning (either independent of or through initial treatment assignment and/or 14-month treatment outcomes); and to compare how these predictors, mediators, and moderators are similar or dissimilar within the normal comparison group. Aim 3 is to track the patterns of risk and protective factors (including their mediation or moderation by initial treatment assignment and/or outcome) involved in early and subsequent stages of developing substance-related disorders and antisocial behavior. Aim 4 is to examine the effect of initial treatment assignment and degree of treatment success on later academic performance, achievement, school conduct, tendency to drop out, and other adverse school outcomes.  In the original MTA design, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions: (1) medication only; (2) psychosocial only; (3) combined (medication and psychosocial); or (4) Assessment-and-Referral condition.

To obtain information on the ability of intranasal peptide T to prevent, halt, and/or reverse the effects of AIDS on the central nervous system.  Studies have shown that AIDS is caused by a retrovirus. This virus works by inactivating or destroying human CD4 cells (which are part of the human immune system). This in turn leads to the observed immunologic defects and related illnesses, including HIV encephalopathy (disease of the brain). One method of preventing AIDS is to prevent HIV from entering the cell. HIV binds to the receptor CD4 site. Peptide T also binds to this site, and thus by competing for that site, can block the binding of the virus to its receptor. Preliminary animal and human studies indicate that peptide T is safe at the doses selected for this trial.  Thirty patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) are entered into the study to receive an increasing schedule of three dosage levels of intranasal peptide T for 12 - 16 weeks followed by a 1-month off-drug follow-up period and a subsequent 1-month return to the drug.

We will look at the separate and combined effects of CST and physical exercise training and evaluate how changes in aerobic fitness, self-effectiveness (a person's belief in his or her ability to reach a goal, such as managing one's own disease), and negative pain-related thoughts relate to improvements in pain and disability.", "year": 1996, "month": 7, "day": 17, "ids": {"alternative_study_ids": [["R01AR044064", "NIAMS-032"], "R01AR044064"], "nct_id": "NCT00000398"}, "track": {"first_submitted": "November 3, 1999", "last_changed_date": "November 27, 2013", "study_start_date": "July 1996"}, "brief_summary": {"study_type": "Interventional", "study_phase": "Phase 2", "condition": ["Fibromyalgia"]}, "study_design": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "recruitment": {"status": "Completed", "enrollment": "180", "completion_date": "June 2000", "eligibility": {"criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:-  Complaints of pain persisting for 6 months-  Meet diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia (American College of Rheumatology criteria)    Exclusion Criteria:-  A significant adverse medical condition that would expose the individual to increased  risk of an adverse experience during the course of the trial (e.g. a recent (<6  months) myocardial infarction)-  An abnormal cardiac response to exercise-  Other significant rheumatic disease-  Receiving or applying for disability or compensation benefits because of fibromyalgia", "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "21 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "location": {"country": "United States"}}, "administration": {"study_sponsor": {"agency": "Ohio University", "agency_class": "Other"}, "collaborator": {"agency": "National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)", "agency_class": "NIH"}, "investigators": {"last_name": "Christopher France, PhD", "role": "Principal Investigator", "affiliation": "Ohio University"}}, "keywords": ["Fibromyalgia", "Pain", "Coping skills training", "Physical exercise training", "Combined coping skills training and exercise training"]}

People on the control boats receive education on injury prevention and road safety while bicycling, rollerblading, and using mopeds. The main result we will look for is Lyme disease identified by a followup survey and confirmed by reviewing medical records. We will also ask some people to take part in a smaller study of behavior change. In this study, we will ask people to complete forms on self-efficacy (a person's belief in his or her ability to reach a certain goal), their plans to take preventive steps, and actual prevention behaviors.

Although the effectiveness of this treatment is not known for HIV-infected individuals, several studies using INH to prevent tuberculosis in presumably normal hosts have shown 60 to 80 percent effectiveness. Problems with this treatment include compliance, adverse reaction, and the possibility of not preventing disease due to tuberculosis organisms being resistant to INH. A two-month preventive treatment plan should help in increasing compliance. In addition, the use of two drugs (rifampin / pyrazinamide) may help overcome problems with drug resistance.

HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for developing intermediate and high-grade NHL. While combination chemotherapy for aggressive B-cell NHL in the absence of immunodeficiency is highly effective, the outcome of therapy for patients with AIDS-associated NHL has been disappointing. Treatment is frequently complicated by the occurrence of multiple opportunistic infections, as well as the presence of poor bone marrow reserve, making the administration of standard doses of chemotherapy difficult. A recent study was completed using a low-dose modification of the standard mBACOD (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin, dexamethasone, methotrexate ) treatment. A 46 percent response rate was observed in patients treated with this combination of chemotherapeutic agents, with a number of durable remissions and reduced toxicity when compared to previous experience with more standard treatments. A subsequent study showed similar effectiveness using a lower dose of methotrexate administered on day 15.

Early immunity to HIV may play an important role in the long interval between virus infection and the onset of clinical disease. Immune responses have been demonstrated in HIV-infected individuals within weeks to months of infection. Although none of these responses has been shown to be protective, it is possible that boosting anti-HIV immune responses through immunization may slow the progression of HIV infection. DTH responses to HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide a means of measuring an important immune function in infected patients, and serve as an easily measured surrogate marker of cellular immunity. In addition to eliciting local, cutaneous DTH responses, intradermal inoculation of skin test antigens may be immunogenic, resulting in new antibody production and cellular immune responses.

The high frequency of sulfonamide-induced toxicity in AIDS patients often makes completion of a full course of therapy difficult.

An additional goal of the study is to obtain a preliminary indication of the antiviral effects of Cd4-IgG in patients with AIDS or ARC.  Other approaches in addition to existing treatment of HIV infection need to be evaluated. One approach may be to block HIV infection by interrupting the assembly of the virus within the cell or the budding of virus from the membrane of the infected cell. In addition, blocking the attachment of HIV to its cellular receptor may offer another point of attack. HIV binds to the CD4 receptor on the target T4 lymphocyte and the envelope glycoprotein of the virus (gp120) is capable of high affinity binding to CD4. Any agent that prevents the attachment of gp120 to the CD4 receptor should be able to block virus transmission and spread. Recently, scientists have succeeded in producing highly purified recombinant soluble human CD4. Recombinant CD4 is capable of binding to HIV envelope protein (gp120) and inhibiting HIV infectivity in test tube studies. Potential therapeutic benefit in patients with HIV infection could be derived from either or both of these biologic effects. In order to extend the length of time that rCD4 stays in the body, the compound has been modified by combining it with a human immunoglobulin of the IgG1 class (IgG).", "year": 1999, "month": 11, "day": 2, "ids": {"alternative_study_ids": ["DO136g", "ACTG 121"], "nct_id": "NCT00000675"}, "track": {"first_submitted": "November 2, 1999", "last_changed_date": "June 24, 2005"}, "brief_summary": {"study_type": "Interventional", "study_phase": "Phase 1", "condition": ["HIV Infections"], "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "CD4-IgG"}}, "study_design": {"primary_purpose": "Treatment"}, "recruitment": {"status": "Completed", "enrollment": "60", "eligibility": {"criteria": "Inclusion Criteria    Patients must fulfill the following criteria:-  Diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS-related complex, according to CDC criteria, in previously  documented HIV seropositive individuals.-  Failure to tolerate or respond to zidovudine (AZT) therapy for HIV infection or a  decision to decline such therapy.-  Willingness to abstain from all other experimental therapy for HIV infection during  study period.-  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.-  Patients must be able to sign a written informed consent form.

Patients included in this study have KS, which is a type of cancer that occurs in nearly 20 percent of patients with AIDS. AIDS patients with extensive KS require treatment with effective cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agents to reduce the tumor size and with antiretroviral agents such as AZT to prevent or ameliorate the development of opportunistic infections. Due to the significant toxic effect of both cytotoxic and antiviral agents on the bone marrow where new blood cells are generated, the combination of these agents is expected to result in complications such as granulocytopenia (very low granulocyte counts).

Does gp160 vaccination of prior HIVAC-1e vaccine result in stimulation of neutralizing antibody and other humoral immune responses? Does vaccination with gp160 enhance the development of cell-mediated immune responses in HIVAC-1e vaccinees?

CMV retinitis is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. DHPG is at present the only drug available for widespread compassionate use in the United States. Although most patients respond to treatment with DHPG, the medication does not cure the infection. Most patients will have a relapse and will require retreatment with DHPG. Because of the large relapse rate, most people treated for CMV retinitis are placed on continuous treatment with DHPG. There are two major problems associated with ongoing use of DHPG: 1) The development of a low white blood cell (WBC) count (leukopenia) which is a known side effect of the drug; and 2) the increased risk for leukopenia when DHPG is given together with AZT, the only antiviral drug currently available for the treatment of HIV infection. Therefore, patients cannot take both AZT and DHPG at the same time because the bone marrow toxicity is made much more severe when the drugs are given together.

In recent studies of the combination of interferon alpha and AZT in patients with KS, more than 40 percent of the patients showed shrinkage of their tumors, and some showed evidence for suppression of HIV growth in the body. However, the combination of IFN-A2b with AZT often caused a marked lowering of the white blood cell (WBC) count, especially a type of WBC called the granulocyte (or neutrophil) which is important in the body's defense against infection.

AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died. The most common severe (grades 3 and 4) toxicities were: transaminase elevation (> 5 x normal) in 94 patients, anemia (< 7.9 g/dl) in 109, neutropenia (< 750 cells/mm3) in 58, fever (> 40 C) in 37, and thrombocytopenia (< 50000 platelets/mm3) in 27. Toxicity required discontinuation of therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients.  Original design: The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, have had to be discontinued in many patients because of severe side effects. Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with LCV, had a high response rate and did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial.", "year": 1999, "month": 11, "day": 2, "ids": {"alternative_study_ids": ["11744", "ACTG 039"], "nct_id": "NCT00000714"}, "track": {"first_submitted": "November 2, 1999", "last_changed_date": "March 29, 2012"}, "brief_summary": {"study_type": "Interventional", "study_phase": "Phase 3", "condition": ["Pneumonia, Pneumocystis Carinii", "HIV Infections"]}, "study_design": {"primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "recruitment": {"status": "Completed", "completion_date": "July 2004", "eligibility": {"criteria": "Inclusion Criteria    Concurrent Medication:    Allowed:-  Noninvestigational therapies as needed.-  Maintenance therapy with investigational triazoles such as itraconazole and SCH 39304.-  High-dose corticosteroids (exceed physiologic replacement doses) including oral  prednisone 40 mg bid for 5 days, 40 mg daily for 5 days and then 20 mg daily for the  remainder of PCP therapy.

Infection with MAC is a poor prognostic indicator in persons with AIDS. Evidence suggests that this poor outcome is not simply a reflection of greater immune impairment in AIDS patients with MAC infection, but rather may be a direct or indirect consequence of infection with mycobacterium. Survival of AIDS patients with MAC is shorter than those without MAC. Studies show that treatment for MAC improves the survival of MAC infected patients to nearly the survival of AIDS patients without MAC. Treatment of MAC with clarithromycin containing regimens is associated with decreased symptoms and prolonged survival. There is evidence, however, that mycobacterial infection may enhance propagation of the human immunodeficiency virus through mechanisms that may involve enhanced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines.

Prior ACTG studies have shown that the 3-drug combination regimen (IDV/ZDV/3TC) resulted in improved clinical outcomes and therefore may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced effects seen with combination therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of RNA replication and alterations in resistance patterns.

When bacteria like Streptococcus (a type of bacteria that causes pneumonia and meningitis) are frequently exposed to antibiotics, the bacteria can become resistant to the drugs. MAC preventive therapy uses antibiotics, but this can make it difficult to treat other infections caused by bacteria that have become resistant in HIV-infected persons.

A substantial number of HIV-infected persons are anergic, and thus do not respond to the only currently available diagnostic tool for tuberculosis infection (that is, the PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test). Many of these anergic persons are, however, infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and eventually develop reactivation tuberculosis, causing both individual illness and spread of infection to others in the community. This study examines the possibility of using INH prophylaxis (that is, for prevention) in anergic HIV-infected patients at high risk for tuberculosis as a means of decreasing the sharp rise in the incidence of tuberculosis due to HIV infection. INH is inexpensive and relatively safe, and thus may demonstrate an acceptable risk/benefit ratio as a medication that can be given over a limited period of time to a population suspected of having, but not proved to have, M. tuberculosis infection.

Effectiveness of ganciclovir and foscarnet is correlated with weekly maintenance and since toxicity is dose-limiting in up to 20 percent of patients receiving either drug for long periods, it may be beneficial in long-term maintenance treatment to combine or alternate these two drugs at a lower total weekly dose of each drug.

AMENDED: To assess whether didanosine (ddI) will be better tolerated than AZT administered by either continuous intravenous delivery or oral administration (ddI arm removed per amended version).To determine whether ddI will achieve comparable clinical efficacy as the continuous intravenous route of delivery of AZT, and to assess whether either or both of these regimens are superior to that achieved with an intermittent AZT dosage schedule. To determine whether there are differences in patient or parent (guardian) compliance between the three treatment regimens. Original design: To determine whether the pharmacokinetic profile (bloodstream levels) of zidovudine (AZT) influences its effectiveness on HIV infection in children. That is, the study seeks to find out whether there is a difference in the effect of AZT when given as a continuous intravenous infusion (and, if available, an oral sustained release dose) compared to an intermittent (not continuous) dose given orally every 6 hours. The study also plans to determine (1) whether there are differences in the tolerance and side effects associated with AZT when given on an intermittent schedule as opposed to a steady-state schedule; (2) the extent of variation from patient to patient in AZT levels and whether the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of AZT are related to the degree of therapeutic effectiveness; and (3) whether there are differences in the response of children who acquired HIV infection perinatally (just before, during, or just after the time of birth) versus those who acquired HIV infection by transfusion.  One of the most serious effects of HIV disease in children is neuropsychological deterioration (relating to mental and nervous system functioning). This complication affects the vast majority of HIV infected children. A previous study of continuous intravenous administration of AZT in pediatric patients with HIV infection showed consistent and dramatic improvements of symptoms in all patients that had shown neurodevelopmental deficits or abnormalities. These improvements were seen within 3 to 4 weeks after AZT treatment was started. Neurodevelopmental improvements have been sustained on AZT, usually showing steady improvement which, in some patients, was associated with restoration of pre-HIV intellectual and neurological function. This study also showed an increase in the IQ scores of children receiving continuous infusion of AZT who did not have overt clinical evidence of encephalopathy (disease of the brain). Thus changes in cognitive function may be among the earliest signs of AIDS encephalopathy and underscores the need to start therapies that will treat the central nervous system in patients who appear to be clinically intact. A study comparing continuous infusion to intermittent dosing of AZT showed a significant increase in IQ scores for those children receiving the continuous dose compared to those treated with the intermittent schedule.

Original design: To determine if granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is helpful in preventing the decreased numbers of white blood cells (infection-fighting cells) associated with ganciclovir ( DHPG ) therapy and to determine if GM-CSF can be safely used in AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis.  AMENDED: In ACTG 004, among 11 AIDS patients with CMV infection receiving DHPG maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, 5x/week) with stable white blood cells (WBC)/absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) 7 (64 percent) required dose reduction or discontinuation of both antiviral medications due to granulocytopenia when AZT (600 mg/day) was added. A mean nadir ANC of 717 cells/ml was reached at a mean of 5 weeks of concomitant DHPG/AZT therapy in these patients. While recovery of depressed ANC occurred following discontinuation of study medications, progressive CMV infection (most commonly retinitis) occurred in 19 of 40 patients and seemed to be associated with DHPG therapy interruption. Only 3 of 40 patients were able to tolerate the complete 16 week study duration of DHPG/AZT. Pharmacokinetic studies of co-administration of DHPG and AZT revealed no significant drug-drug interactions. The study investigators concluded that the main, treatment limiting toxicity of combination DHPG/AZT therapy is granulocytopenia and that many patients treated on this study developed intercurrent OIs or staphylococcal septicemia. In order to determine whether patients receiving maintenance DHPG therapy with or without GM-CSF can tolerate concomitant AZT therapy, extended maintenance therapy with the assigned study regimen in combination with AZT will be incorporated into this protocol. Original design: CMV infection causes inflammation of the retina and can lead to permanent blindness. Treatment for CMV retinitis with DHPG has been shown to be effective in halting the progression of retinal disease. During DHPG treatment, however, about 30 to 55 percent of patients develop decreased white blood cell counts. GM-CSF, a naturally occurring human hormone, stimulates the body's bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. Studies with GM-CSF in AIDS patients have shown that it can significantly increase depressed white blood cell counts in these patients.", "year": 1999, "month": 11, "day": 2, "ids": {"alternative_study_ids": ["11047", "ACTG 073"], "nct_id": "NCT00000989"}, "track": {"first_submitted": "November 2, 1999", "last_changed_date": "April 30, 2012"}, "brief_summary": {"study_type": "Interventional", "study_phase": "N/A", "condition": ["Cytomegalovirus Retinitis", "HIV Infections"]}, "study_design": {"intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment"}, "recruitment": {"status": "Completed", "enrollment": "50", "completion_date": "July 1992", "eligibility": {"criteria": "Inclusion Criteria    Concurrent Medication:    Allowed:-  Maintenance therapy for stable opportunistic infection which is not myelosuppressive.-  Aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.-  Acyclovir or other appropriate medications for appearance of Herpes simplex virus or  Varicella zoster virus infections (after enrollment in study) that require systemic  therapy.-  Medications absolutely necessary for the patient's welfare, at discretion of  investigator.

Original design: To evaluate the short-term effects of combined administration of zidovudine (AZT) and increasing doses of recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients infected with HIV, who have lymphadenopathy, but who are otherwise asymptomatic (no other symptoms). The first phase of this clinical trial will establish maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). How quickly the drugs get into the blood and how long they remain there (pharmacokinetics) will also be studied at each dose as well as the effect on HIV.  Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2, as well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity, increase the theoretical benefits of combining AZT, a drug which has clinically significant activity in HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of latently infected cells.", "year": 1999, "month": 11, "day": 2, "ids": {"alternative_study_ids": ["11017", "ACTG 042"], "nct_id": "NCT00001005"}, "track": {"first_submitted": "November 2, 1999", "last_changed_date": "April 26, 2012"}, "brief_summary": {"study_type": "Interventional", "study_phase": "Phase 1", "condition": ["HIV Infections"]}, "study_design": {"primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "recruitment": {"status": "Completed", "enrollment": "30", "completion_date": "February 1995", "eligibility": {"criteria": "Inclusion Criteria    Concurrent Medication:    Allowed:-  Necessary topical agents, including nystatin or clotrimazole, as well as acyclovir.

Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in body fat and a decrease in LBM. Concomitant testosterone replacement should substantially increase the amount of LBM accrued during megestrol acetate therapy.

The present study, therefore, will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and oral AZT administration to HIV-1 infected pregnant women in the 3rd trimester, as well as the safety and efficacy of such treatment in their newborns.  It is hoped that the results will be instrumental in designing future studies to assess the efficacy of AZT in reducing the transmission risk of HIV-1.", "year": 1999, "month": 11, "day": 2, "ids": {"alternative_study_ids": ["11057", "ACTG 082"], "nct_id": "NCT00001106"}, "track": {"first_submitted": "November 2, 1999", "last_changed_date": "June 3, 2015"}, "brief_summary": {"study_type": "Interventional", "study_phase": "Phase 1", "condition": ["HIV Infections", "Pregnancy"], "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Zidovudine"}}, "study_design": {"primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "recruitment": {"status": "Completed", "enrollment": "40", "completion_date": "March 1994", "eligibility": {"criteria": "Inclusion Criteria    Concurrent Medication:    Allowed:-  In one group of four or more patients, methadone maintenance treatment.-  Acetaminophen for periods less than 72 hours.-  Supportive therapy including blood and blood products, vaginal creams, antiemetics,  antidiarrheals, and cough medicines as deemed necessary by the responsible  investigator.-  Iron, multivitamins, and short course of treatment for correctable medical problems,  such as urinary tract infection.

Previous studies have shown that IFN-alpha can induce regression of Kaposi's sarcoma and suppression of HIV in some patients. Although various trials using IFN-alpha in combination with the nucleoside analogue zidovudine have demonstrated a high degree of antitumor activity and evidence of HIV suppression, the overlapping toxicity (primarily neutropenia) of these two agents has proven dose-limiting.
